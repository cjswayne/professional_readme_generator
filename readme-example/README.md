  ## Description
  
  In this project I created the backend for an unfinished frontend note taker app. The goal of the app is to take notes, and the problem it solves is allowing a user to open the app, write down and save notes, then later the user can look at past notes or delete past notes if they wanted to. Things I learned were how to set up a backend server for a frontend app. restart your recording?
